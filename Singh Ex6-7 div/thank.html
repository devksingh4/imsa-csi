	<h1>Thank you! Your response has (not) been recorded!</h1>
	<p>Unfortunately, we don't have any servers to record your response with.
	<br>
    <br>Access to servers are part of the educational experience, but access to full resources is limited in the interest of simulating real world educational process for the team.</p>
	<p>The primary reason we don't have servers is due to how these types of systems would be deployed in the real world.</p>
	<p>I expect the server administrators to have issues commingling their webserver with the other servers.</p>

	<!-- Block vs. Inline Styling: Block creates new line per element, and takes up full width it can. 
		 Inline is the exact opposite: every element continues to remain on the current line and only takes up the space it needs to.-->
